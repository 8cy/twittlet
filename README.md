# Twittlet

## What?
Got a little bored and realized that I want to eventually add a downloader service to my projects site which interacts with my Twitter bot. This is in a very early stage and at the moment its just a simple Twitter media API and downloader.

## Is it done?
No.

Will probably end up adding some of the few things down below.

- [ ] YouTube + other service(s) support
- [x] Clean up codebase, namely `server.js`...
- [ ] Add handling to remove the .m3u8 file from the returned data.
- [ ] Add a method to get the size of the files (both dimensions and data size) and list that next to the links.
- [ ] Possible Bootstrap menu for cleaner look and tidy-ness.

### Also
`app.js` is just me testing to see if this package will even work. Way cleaner than the actual `server.js` codebase so if you are going to nab this, please nab that.
